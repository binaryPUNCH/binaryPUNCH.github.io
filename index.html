        <p>Its main purpose is for me to play with the technologies I find interesting and wish to learn. The server is hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance (vps), running as a free-tier t2.micro instance (Ubuntu-x64 OS). </p>

        <p>Brief directory of what to find:</p>

            <li>
                <p><a href="http://tech-flex.com ">tech-flex.com</a><br> The static page you're currently viewing, actually resides at GitHub Pages and not my VPS (awesome for free static sites).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><a href="http://blog.tech-flex.com ">blog.tech-flex.com</a><br> My personal blog using the (in)famous Wordpress. All the posts are 5+ years old, so don't judge me :-) I do, however, have plans for more content in the near future (heads up for "Continous-deployment with AppVeyor" &amp; some "Basic JSON.NET use cases").</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><a href="http://mvc.tech-flex.com ">mvc.tech-flex.com</a><br> My ASP.NET Core MVC 6 playground, with a slick deploy strategy. Commits to the master git-branch are <a href="https://ci.appveyor.com/project/amivit/straight-line
        ">automatically built</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/amivit/Straight-Line/blob/master/appveyor.yml#L23-L37 ">deployed live</a>. Thanks to AppVeyor for freely enabling this continous-delivery architecture (at the "cost" of staying open-source, but this is totally cool!). For a future blog post, I will go in-depth with the deployment strategy and how it works.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Entity Framework Core connected to a MySQL Amazon RDS database</li>
                    <li>Future goals: Add javascript SPA functionality &amp; webpack (likely with Angular2 or Vue.js, maybe React)</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><a href="http://www.jakupwhansen.dk/">www.jakupwhansen.dk</a><br>A bonus link to my coding teachers personal site, to whom I owe a lot of inspiration from.</p>

        </ul>

        <p>Nginx is used for the blog and Kestrel for the .NET Core site (however Nginx sits in front proxying, since they can't both bind to port 80). Supervisor is used to manage (start/stop/update) .NET Core. Would love to encapsulate the entire project here
            to a container with autoscaling CloudFormation (loadbalancers, Route3 and everything... a future project).</p>

        <p>"There is value in taking a moment to think about the deep and broad stack that your application sits on. Go thank and support the projects, both open source and not, that your application uses. Revel in the layers of abstraction that others
        have created and appreciate the ones that you have created. They make all the LEGO pieces you're using just the correct size, and they make snapping them together a lot of fun. It's a great time to be a programmer. " - <em><a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/WeAreAbstractingOnTheShouldersOfGiants.aspx ">We are abstracting on the shoulders of giants</a></em></p>
