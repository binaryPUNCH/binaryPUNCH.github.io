  "body": "### Welcome to my site!\r\nIts main purpose is for me to play with the technologies I find interesting and wish to learn. The server is hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance (vps), running on a free-tier t2.micro instance (Ubuntu-x64 OS). \r\n\r\nBrief directory of what to find:\r\n\r\n* [tech-flex.com](http://tech-flex.com)  \r\nThis static page you're currently viewing actually resides at GitHub pages and not my VPS (awesome for a free static site).\r\n\r\n* [blog.tech-flex.com](http://blog.tech-flex.com)  \r\nMy personal blog running on Wordpress, if it was not obvious. All the posts are +5 years old, so don't judge me :-). I do, however, have plans for more content in the near future (Heads up for \"Continous-deployment with AppVeyor\" & some \"basic JSON.NET usecases\")\r\n\r\n* [mvc.tech-flex.com](http://mvc.tech-flex.com)  \r\nMy ASP.NET Core MVC6 playground, with a slick deploy strategy. Commits to the master git-branch are [automatically built](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/amivit/straight-line) & [deployed live](https://github.com/amivit/Straight-Line/blob/master/appveyor.yml#L23-L37). Thanks to AppVeyor.com for allowing continous-delivery strategy for free. I will go in depth about this Read more about it in my blog post here.  \r\n\t* Entity Framework Core connected to a MySQL Amazon RDS database\r\n\t* Future goals: Add javascript SPA funcitonality & webpack (likely with Angular2 or Vue.js, maybe React).\r\n\r\nNginx is used for the blog and Kestrel for the MVC6 site (however Nginx sits in front proxying, since they can't both bind to port 80). Supervisor is used to manage (start/stop/update) MVC6. Would love to encapsulate the entire project here to a container with self-scaling CloudFormation (loadbalancers, Route3 and everything... project for another day)\r\n***\r\n \"There is value in taking a moment to think about the deep and broad stack that your application sits on. Go thank and support the projects, both open source and not, that your application uses. Revel in the layers of abstraction that others have created and appreciate the ones that you have created. They make all the LEGO pieces you're using just the correct size, and they make snapping them together a lot of fun. It's a great time to be a programmer.\" - _[We are abstracting on the shoulders of giants](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/WeAreAbstractingOnTheShouldersOfGiants.aspx)_\r\n\r\nEnjoy your stay!  \r\npaul@wittig.dk",
